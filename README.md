The sequel to the hit tactics game Door Kickers, Task Force North brings you the best portrayal of modern Close Quarters Combat and Tactics in a video game.

Control Special Operation Units in daring raids to rescue hostages, neutralize and capture terrorists in the fictional country of Nowheraki, Middle East.

Top-down tactics with Real Time gameplay but pause-at-will allows you to think, rethink, and still bite your nails as the action happens. And there's no turns, hexes or action points to manage. 

The game models deadly threats and techs: suicide bombers, IEDs and Rocket-Propelled Grenades - but gives you tools to dominate: Light Machine Guns for suppressive fire, Night Vision Goggles to own the night and wall breaching charges to open new entry points.

Destructible environment lets you progress through the non-linear levels. If something stands in your way, tear it down! Any strategy is viable.

You can even choose the unit to deploy for any mission:

* U.S. Army Rangers - firepower, numbers and skilled, coordinated violence.

* CIA Special Activities Division - small unit of Covert Operators, able to go undercover but also deliver surgical strikes when needed.

* Nowheraki SWAT - grit, improvised tech and gear borrowed from their US advisors.

It's NOT  just skins and weapons, but distinct playing style, abilities and unit doctrines.

Should there be more units? Tell us what YOU think!
